# Jakarta Messaging (JMS)

@@@ note { title="Jakarta Messaging (JMS)" }

The Jakarta Messaging API (formerly Java Message Service or JMS API) is a Java application programming interface (API) for message-oriented middleware. It provides generic messaging models, able to handle the producerâ€“consumer problem, that can be used to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between software systems. Jakarta Messaging is a part of [Jakarta EE]((https://jakarta.ee)) and was originally defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems before being guided by the Java Community Process.
