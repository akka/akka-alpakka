# Alpakka 1.0-M1

# First milestone release for Alpakka 1.0

Many modules have been restructured to meet the preferred code layout as illustrated by the [Reference connector](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/alpakka/current/reference.html).

On this [Road to Alpakka 1.0](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/alpakka-towards-1.0) we are deliberately making a lot of non-compatible API changes to many connectors. From version 1.0 Alpakka will stay [binary-compatible](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#binary-compatibility-rules) between minor releases.

Having that said, Alpakka will start to make use of the `@ApiMayChange` annotation to keep the door open for API changes in new modules, so that they can evolve more rapidly than other modules within Alpakka.

Even modules that have been changed to meet Alpakka 1.0 standards might get more API-breaking changes before Alpakka reaches 1.0. If you prefer adapting to these changes in one bigger step, keep the version you are using until Alpakka 1.0 is final.
